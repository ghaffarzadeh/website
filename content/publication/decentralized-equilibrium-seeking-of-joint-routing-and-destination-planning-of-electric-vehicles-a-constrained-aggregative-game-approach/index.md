abstract: Increasing the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in public
  transportation, which is also sped up by governments’ carbon net-zero
  policies, will significantly increase the demand for electricity. Therefore,
  when we face with a large population of selfish EV users, we need a
  coordination mechanism to manage both the traffic congestion and electricity
  resource limitations. This paper introduces a novel aggregative game model
  where heterogeneous EVs simultaneously plan their parking lot as their
  destination (usually accompanied by battery charging) and the route to the
  destination. The cost function of users consists of factors such as traveling
  time, variable costs of congestion and electricity demand, and tolling which
  is imposed to satisfy coupling constraints such as roads’ capacity and
  stations’ power capacity. Since the users are selfish and do not reveal their
  objectives and personal constraints, we propose a privacy preserving
  decentralized algorithm with a traffic coordinator and multiple stations’
  coordinators for generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking of the game model.
  Only aggregate information such as traffic on the road and stations’ energy
  demand are available to the traffic coordinator and charging stations’
  coordinators, respectively. We show that the proposed aggregative game admits
  a unique variational generalized Nash equilibrium (v-GNE). Then, using the
  theory of variational inequality (VI), we show that the proposed decentralized
  algorithm converges to the unique v-GNE of the game. Finally, we carry out
  comprehensive simulation studies on a simulated Savannah city model to compare
  and evaluate the proposed method.

summary: In this paper, we propose a coordination mechanism using incentive
  pricing to simultaneously manage both the traffic congestion and electricity
  resource limitations in presence of a large population of selfish EV users.
  The article introduces a novel aggregative game model where heterogeneous EVs
  simultaneously plan their parking lot as their destination (usually
  accompanied by battery charging) and the route to the destination. The factors
  such as traveling time, variable costs of congestion and electricity demand,
  and tolling which is imposed to satisfy coupling constraints such as road
  capacity and station power capacity are considered in the model. Since the
  users are selfish and do not reveal their objectives and personal constraints,
  the proposed scheme is a privacy preserving decentralized algorithm with a
  traffic coordinator and multiple station’ coordinators. The solution concept
  is the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) point of the game model.
